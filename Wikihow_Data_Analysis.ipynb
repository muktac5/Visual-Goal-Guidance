Additionally, choose a fabric that is thick enough that it won’t require two layers or a slip. You will need between 2–3 yards (1.8–2.7 m) of fabric total depending on your size and the length of the dress. Try using a large over sized t-shirt as the base for your dress. These can be found in thrift stores or even in the back of your own closet. Get creative with your fabric choice and try using a sheet or curtain as the fabric for your dress.

Most patterns already have this included in their measurements, but you will need to keep this in mind if you are tracing a dress for your pattern. If you want to add sleeves to your dress, these will need to be cut as separate pieces from the body of the dress. Cut your dress fabric in a tank-style top and then sew your sleeves on later.
